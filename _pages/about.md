This is the personal website of Sebastián Duque hosted at [sduquer.github.io](https://sduquer.github.io).

This website, just like life, is under construction permanently. It is not written in my mother tongue 
so it could have some grammar mistakes, however i like the challenges.

The idea is documenting my projects and organize my ideas (by writing down them), and in the way of trying to explain them, i can understand better and new ideas come up. 

Also, I hope that somebody can find something useful here. It is just a sincere attempt to contribute.

Let's keep in touch, this is my email {% include email-about.html %}

Additionally, you can review my social media links in the sidebar.

This site is built using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), with a layout based on the [Hyde theme](https://github.com/poole/hyde) by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo) and also I took some ideas of [jreel](https://jreel.github.io/). Thanks to both for sharing your work.
