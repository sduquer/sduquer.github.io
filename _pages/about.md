This is the personal website of Sebastián Duque hosted at [sduquer.github.io](https://sduquer.github.io).

This website, just like life, is under construction permanently. It is not written in my mother language 
so it could have some grammar mistakes, but i like the challenges, and this a new one.

Please, let's keep in touch, this is my email: {% include email-about.html %}

Additionally, you can review my social media links in the sidebar.

This site is built using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), with a layout based on the [Hyde theme](https://github.com/poole/hyde) by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo) and also I took some ideas of [jreel](https://jreel.github.io/). Thanks to both for sharing your work.
